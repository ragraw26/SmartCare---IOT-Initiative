# SmartCare-IOT-Initiative

Internet of Things (Smarter Care) - Java Swing Application

#Description

Developed an enterprise application using Java and implemented it using the Eco-System model.
Built the application using Singleton design pattern to implement the concept of user registration, user login, work requests and work queues to be performed by users with different roles.
A similar idea has already started to be implemented in IBM known as the 'Smarter Care'.The link to it: https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/value-based-care/watson-care-manager/
